# musical-octo-palm-tree

## Why a palm tree?

I planned to make something entirely different, but github gave the randomly generated repo title "octo-musical-palm-tree". I realised that there truly are not enough of these around so I made one. Problem solved

Using only the latest in musical palm tree technology, this palm tree can make several musical notes such as A and B.
In addition the leaves are displayed in only the most pristine SVG graphics available to modern(post-2000) browsers. As seen above, this is a free version of the new and upcoming palm-tree technology the next one will be plated gold and feature 8 sounds from multiple instruments in multiple octaves including bagpipes. Please donate 1 million dollars here if you would like to experience this revolutionary and disruptive technology.
